## Adding Projects and Internships from LinkedIn

Since LinkedIn doesn't allow automated scraping, you'll need to manually extract your data:

1. Visit your LinkedIn profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/kanishka-sonkar-30520a243/
2. Copy your projects and internships information
3. Edit the component files directly:
   - `components/Projects.tsx` for projects
   - `components/Internships.tsx` for internships
