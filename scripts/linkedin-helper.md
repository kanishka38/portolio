# LinkedIn Data Helper

This directory contains helper scripts and guides for extracting and formatting LinkedIn data.

## Files:

1. **extract-linkedin-data.js** - Node.js script to help format your LinkedIn data
2. **LINKEDIN_DATA_GUIDE.md** (in root) - Complete guide for extracting LinkedIn data

## Quick Start:

Since LinkedIn restricts automated scraping, you'll need to:

1. Visit your LinkedIn profile manually
2. Copy the projects and internships information
3. Use the helper script or edit components directly

## Alternative: Browser Extension Method

You could also use browser extensions like:
- "Copy All URLs" to extract links
- "LinkedIn Data Extractor" (if available)
- Manual copy-paste (recommended for accuracy)

## Python Script Alternative

If you prefer Python, you could create a script using:
- Selenium (but this violates LinkedIn's ToS)
- Manual data entry script (recommended)

The safest and most reliable method is manual extraction and formatting.
